# We'd like to alias the runfiles target @bazel_tools//tools/python/runfiles.
# However, we need its source file to exist in the runfiles tree under this
# repo's name, so that it can be imported as
#
#     from rules_python.python.runfiles import runfiles
#
# in user code. This requires either adding a symlink to runfiles or copying
# the file with an action.
#
# Both solutions are made more difficult by the fact that runfiles.py is not
# directly exported by its package. We could try to get a handle on its File
# object by unpacking the runfiles target's providers, but this seems hacky
# and is probably more effort than it's worth. Also, it's not trivial to copy
# files in a cross-platform (i.e. Windows-friendly) way.
#
# So instead, we just vendor in runfiles.py here.
