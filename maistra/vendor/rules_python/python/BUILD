"""This package contains two sets of rules:

    1) the "core" Python rules, which were historically bundled with Bazel and
       are now either re-exported or copied into this repository; and

    2) the packaging rules, which were historically simply known as
       rules_python.

In an ideal renaming, we'd move the packaging rules to a different package so
that @rules_python//python is only concerned with the core rules.

# This target can be used to inspect the current Python major version. To use,
# put it in the `flag_values` attribute of a `config_setting` and test it
# against the values "PY2" or "PY3". It will always match one or the other.
#
# If you do not need to test any other flags in combination with the Python
# version, then as a convenience you may use the predefined `config_setting`s
# `@rules_python//python:PY2` and `@rules_python//python:PY3`.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     config_setting(
#         name = "py3_on_arm",
#         values = {"cpu": "arm"},
#         flag_values = {"@rules_python//python:python_version": "PY3"},

#             ...
#         }),
#         ...
#     )
#
# Caution: Do not `select()` on the built-in command-line flags `--force_python`
# or `--python_version`, as they do not always reflect the true Python version
# of the current target. `select()`-ing on them can lead to action conflicts and
# will be disallowed.
