# Trick bazel into treating BUILD files under examples/* as being regular files
# This lets us glob() up all the files inside the examples to make them inputs to tests

# To update these lines, run tools/bazel_integration_test/update_deleted_packages.sh

# creating (possibly empty) __init__.py files and adding them to the srcs of
# Python targets as required.
