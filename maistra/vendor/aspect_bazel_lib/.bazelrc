### PROJECT SPECIFIC OPTIONS ###

# For testing our --stamp behavior.
# Normally users would use a --workspace_status_command with a script that calls `git describe`.
build --embed_label=v1.2.3

# For releasing, use --workspace_status_command and stamp
build:release --workspace_status_command "${PWD}/workspace_status.sh"
build:release -c opt --stamp

# Load any settings & overrides specific to the current user from `.aspect/bazelrc/user.bazelrc`.
# This file should appear in `.gitignore` so that settings are not shared with team members. This
# should be last statement in this config so the user configuration is able to overwrite flags from
# this file. See https://bazel.build/configure/best-practices#bazelrc-file.
try-import %workspace%/.aspect/bazelrc/user.bazelrc
