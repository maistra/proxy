    added support for SNI-based cert selection in tls downstream transport socket. Detailed documentation is available :ref:`cert selection<arch_overview_ssl_cert_select>`.
    New config option :ref:`full_scan_certs_on_sni_mismatch <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.DownstreamTlsContext.full_scan_certs_on_sni_mismatch>`

    can cause a crash.
