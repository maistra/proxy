  area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fix a bug where the ext_authz filter will ignore the request body when the
    :ref:`pack_as_bytes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.BufferSettings.pack_as_bytes>` is set to true and
    HTTP authorization service is configured.

- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
