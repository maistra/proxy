1.13.1 (March 3, 2020)
======================

Changes
-------

* buffer: force copy when appending small slices to OwnedImpl buffer to avoid fragmentation.
* http: added HTTP/1.1 flood protection. Can be temporarily disabled using the runtime feature ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_flood_protection``.
* listeners: fixed issue where :ref:`TLS inspector listener filter <v1.13:config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` could have been bypassed by a client using only TLS 1.3.
* rbac: added :ref:`url_path <v1.13:envoy_api_field_config.rbac.v2.Permission.url_path>` for matching URL path without the query and fragment string.
* sds: fixed the SDS vulnerability that TLS validation context (e.g., subject alt name or hash) cannot be effectively validated in some cases.
