1.19.3 (February 22, 2022)
==========================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

* dns_filter: :ref:`dns_filter <v1.19:envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3alpha.DnsFilterConfig>`
  protobuf fields have been renumbered to restore compatibility with Envoy
  1.18, breaking compatibility with Envoy 1.19.0 and 1.19.1. The new field
  numbering allows control planes supporting Envoy 1.18 to gracefully upgrade to
  :ref:`dns_resolution_config <v1.19:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3alpha.DnsFilterConfig.ClientContextConfig.dns_resolution_config>`,
  provided they skip over Envoy 1.19.0 and 1.19.1.
  Control planes upgrading from Envoy 1.19.0 and 1.19.1 will need to
  vendor the corresponding protobuf definitions to ensure that the
  renumbered fields have the types expected by those releases.

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* data plane: fix crash when internal redirect selects a route configured with direct response or redirect actions.
* jwt_authn: fixed the crash when a CONNECT request is sent to JWT filter configured with regex match on the Host header.
* listener: fixed an issue on Windows where connections are not handled by all worker threads.
* tcp_proxy: fix a crash that occurs when configured for :ref:`upstream tunneling <v1.19:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.tunneling_config>` and the downstream connection disconnects while the the upstream connection or http/2 stream is still being established.
