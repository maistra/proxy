Removed Config or Runtime
-------------------------
*Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <v1.15:deprecated>`

New Features
------------
* http: added the ability to :ref:`unescape slash sequences <v1.15:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action>` in the path. Requests with unescaped slashes can be proxied, rejected or redirected to the new unescaped path. By default this feature is disabled. The default behavior can be overridden through :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action <v1.15:config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action>` runtime variable. This action can be selectively enabled for a portion of requests by setting the :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action_sampling <v1.15:config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action_enabled>` runtime variable.

Deprecated
