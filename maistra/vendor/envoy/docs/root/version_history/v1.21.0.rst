1.21.0 (January 12, 2022)
=========================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

* auto_config: :ref:`auto_config <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.auto_config>` now verifies that any transport sockets configured via :ref:`transport_socket_matches <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matches>` support ALPN. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.correctly_validate_alpn`` to false.
* xds: ``*`` became a reserved name for a wildcard resource that can be subscribed to and unsubscribed from at any time. This is a requirement for implementing the on-demand xDSes (like on-demand CDS) that can subscribe to specific resources next to their wildcard subscription. If such xDS is subscribed to both wildcard resource and to other specific resource, then in stream reconnection scenario, the xDS will not send an empty initial request, but a request containing ``*`` for wildcard subscription and the rest of the resources the xDS is subscribed to. If the xDS is only subscribed to wildcard resource, it will try to send a legacy wildcard request. This behavior implements the recent changes in :ref:`xDS protocol <v1.21:xds_protocol>` and can be temporarily reverted by setting the ``envoy.restart_features.explicit_wildcard_resource`` runtime guard to false.

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* bandwidth_limit: added :ref:`response trailers <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.bandwidth_limit.v3.BandwidthLimit.enable_response_trailers>` when request or response delay are enforced.
* bandwidth_limit: added :ref:`bandwidth limit stats <v1.21:config_http_filters_bandwidth_limit>` *request_enforced* and *response_enforced*.
* dns: now respecting the returned DNS TTL for resolved hosts, rather than always relying on the hard-coded :ref:`dns_refresh_rate. <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.dns_refresh_rate>`. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_dns_ttl`` to false.
* ext_authz: the ext_authz span was always getting sampled, even if the parent span was not; now the ext_authz span follows the parent's sampling status.
* http: directly responding with only a 1xx http status code isn't valid, and is now refused as invalid :ref:`direct_response <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.direct_response>` config.
* http: envoy will now proxy 102 and 103 headers from upstream, though as with 100s only the first 1xx response headers will be sent. This behavioral change by can temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.proxy_102_103`` to false.
* http: usage of the experimental matching API is no longer guarded behind a feature flag, as the corresponding protobuf fields have been marked as WIP.
* http: when a downstream connection hits a configured ``max_requests_per_connection``, it will send an HTTP/2 "shutdown notification" (GOAWAY frame with max stream ID) and go to a default grace period of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) if :ref:`drain_timeout <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.drain_timeout>` is not specified. During this grace period, envoy will continue to accept new streams. After the grace period, a final GOAWAY is sent and envoy will start refusing new streams. However before the bugfix, during the grace period, every time a new stream is received, envoy would restart the drain which caused the grace period to be extended and so making it longer than the configured drain timeout.
* json: switching from rapidjson to nlohmann/json. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.remove_legacy_json`` to false.
* listener: destroy per network filter chain stats when a network filter chain is removed during the listener in place update.
* router: take elapsed time into account when setting the ``x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms header`` for retries, and never send a value that's longer than the request timeout. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.update_expected_rq_timeout_on_retry`` to false.
* stream_info: response code details with empty space characters (' ', '\\t', '\\f', '\\v', '\\n', '\\r') is not accepted by the ``setResponseCodeDetails()`` API.
* upstream: fixed a bug where auto_config didn't work for wrapped TLS sockets (e.g. if proxy proto were configured for TLS).

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* ext_authz: fix the ext_authz http filter to correctly set response flags to ``UAEX`` when a connection is denied.
* ext_authz: fix the ext_authz network filter to correctly set response flag and code details to ``UAEX`` when a connection is denied.
* hcm: stop processing the response if encoding it has caused downstream reset. The fix is guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.handle_stream_reset_during_hcm_encoding``.
* listener: fixed issue where more than one listener could listen on the same port if using reuse port, thus randomly accepting connections on different listeners. This configuration is now rejected.
* tcp: fixing a log error where errors both from the kernel and the transport were not handled gracefully.
* thrift_proxy: do not close downstream connections when an upstream connection overflow happens.
* thrift_proxy: fix the thrift_proxy connection manager to correctly report success/error response metrics when performing :ref:`payload passthrough <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.ThriftProxy.payload_passthrough>`.
