SNI dynamic forward proxy
=========================

.. attention::

  SNI dynamic forward proxy support should be considered alpha and not production ready.

Through the combination of :ref:`TLS inspector <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` listener filter,
this network filter and the
:ref:`dynamic forward proxy cluster <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.clusters.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.ClusterConfig>`,
Envoy supports SNI based dynamic forward proxy. The implementation works just like the
:ref:`HTTP dynamic forward proxy <arch_overview_http_dynamic_forward_proxy>`, but using the value in
SNI as target host instead.

The following is a complete configuration that configures both this filter
as well as the :ref:`dynamic forward proxy cluster
<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.clusters.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.ClusterConfig>`. Both filter and cluster
must be configured together and point to the same DNS cache parameters for Envoy to operate as an
SNI dynamic forward proxy.

.. note::

  The following config doesn't terminate TLS in listener, so there is no need to configure TLS context
  in cluster. The TLS handshake is passed through by Envoy.
