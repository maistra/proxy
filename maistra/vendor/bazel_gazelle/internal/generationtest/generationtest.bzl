    gazelle_generation_test is a macro for testing gazelle against workspaces.

    The generation test expects a file structure like the following:

    ```
    |-- <testDataPath>
        |-- some_test
            |-- WORKSPACE
            |-- README.md --> README describing what the test does.
            |-- expectedStdout.txt --> Expected stdout for this test.
            |-- expectedStderr.txt --> Expected stderr for this test.
            |-- expectedExitCode.txt --> Expected exit code for this test.
            |-- app
                |-- sourceFile.foo
                |-- BUILD.in --> BUILD file prior to running gazelle.
                |-- BUILD.out --> BUILD file expected after running gazelle.
    ```

    To update the expected files, run `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=true bazel run //path/to:the_test_target`.

    Args:
        name: The name of the test.
        gazelle_binary: The name of the gazelle binary target. For example, //path/to:my_gazelle.
        test_data: A list of target of the test data files you will pass to the test.
            This can be a https://bazel.build/reference/be/general#filegroup.
        build_in_suffix: The suffix for the input BUILD.bazel files. Defaults to .in.
            By default, will use files named BUILD.in as the BUILD files before running gazelle.
        build_out_suffix: The suffix for the expected BUILD.bazel files after running gazelle. Defaults to .out.
            By default, will use files named check the results of the gazelle run against files named BUILD.out.
