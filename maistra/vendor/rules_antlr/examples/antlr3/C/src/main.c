//        there is no reason that this MUST be the case. Provided that you know how
//        to run the antlr tool, then just compile the resulting .c files and this
//	  file together, using say gcc or whatever: gcc *.c -I. -o XXX
//	  The C code is generic and will compile and run on all platforms (please
//        report any warnings or errors to the antlr-interest newsgroup (see www.antlr.org)

// You may adopt your own practices by all means, but in general it is best
// to create a single include for your project, that will include the ANTLR3 C
// runtime header files, the generated header files (all of which are safe to include
// multiple times) and your own project related header files. Use <> to include and
// -I on the compile line (which vs2005 now handles, where vs2003 did not).

    // Now we declare the ANTLR related local variables we need.
    // Note that unless you are convinced you will never need thread safe
    // versions for your project, then you should always create such things
    // as instance variables for each invocation.
    // -------------------

    // Name of the input file. Note that we always use the abstract type pANTLR3_UINT8
    // for ASCII/8 bit strings - the runtime library garauntees that this will be
    // good on all platforms. This is a general rule - always use the ANTLR3 supplied
    // typedefs for pointers/types/etc.
    //
    pANTLR3_UINT8	    fName;

    // The ANTLR3 character input stream, which abstracts the input source such that
    // it is easy to privide inpput from different sources such as files, or 
    // memory strings.
    //
    // For an ASCII/latin-1 memory string use:
    //	    input = antlr3NewAsciiStringInPlaceStream (stringtouse, (ANTLR3_UINT64) length, NULL);
    //
    // For a UCS2 (16 bit) memory string use:
    //	    input = antlr3NewUCS2StringInPlaceStream (stringtouse, (ANTLR3_UINT64) length, NULL);
    //
    // For input from a file, see code below
    //
    // Note that this is essentially a pointer to a structure containing pointers to functions.
    // You can create your own input stream type (copy one of the existing ones) and override any
    // individual function by installing your own pointer after you have created the standard 
    // version.
    //
    pANTLR3_INPUT_STREAM    input;

    // The lexer is of course generated by ANTLR, and so the lexer type is not upper case.
    // The lexer is supplied with a pANTLR3_INPUT_STREAM from whence it consumes its
    // input and generates a token stream as output.
    //
    pTLexer		    lxr;

    // The token stream is produced by the ANTLR3 generated lexer. Again it is a structure based
    // API/Object, which you can customise and override methods of as you wish. a Token stream is
    // supplied to the generated parser, and you can write your own token stream and pass this in
    // if you wish.
    //
    pANTLR3_COMMON_TOKEN_STREAM	    tstream;

    // The C parser is also generated by ANTLR and accepts a token stream as explained
    // above. The token stream can be any source in fact, so long as it implements the 
    // ANTLR3_TOKEN_SOURCE interface. In this case the parser does not return anything
    // but it can of cousre speficy any kind of return type from the rule you invoke
    // when calling it.
    //

    // NB: Nothing happens yet other than the file has been read. We are just 
    // connecting all these things together and they will be invoked when we
    // call the parser rule. ANTLR3_SIZE_HINT can be left at the default usually
    // unless you have a very large token stream/input. Each generated lexer
    // provides a token source interface, which is the second argument to the
    // token stream creator.
    // Note tha even if you implement your own token structure, it will always
    // contain a standard common token within it and this is the pointer that
    // you pass around to everything else. A common token as a pointer within
    // it that should point to your own outer token structure.
    //
    tstream = antlr3CommonTokenStreamSourceNew(ANTLR3_SIZE_HINT, TOKENSOURCE(lxr));

    // We are all ready to go. Though that looked complicated at first glance,
    // I am sure, you will see that in fact most of the code above is dealing
    // with errors and there isn't really that much to do (isn't this always the
    // case in C? ;-).
    //
    // So, we now invoke the parser. All elements of ANTLR3 generated C components
    // as well as the ANTLR C runtime library itself are pseudo objects. This means
    // that they are represented as pointers to structures, which contain any
    // instance data they need, and a set of pointers to other interfaces or
    // 'methods'. Note that in general, these few pointers we have created here are
    // the only things you will ever explicitly free() as everything else is created
    // via factories, that allocate memory efficiently and free() everything they use
    // automatically when you close the parser/lexer/etc.
    //
    // Note that this means only that the methods are always called via the object
    // pointer and the first argument to any method, is a pointer to the structure itself.
    // It also has the side advantage, if you are using an IDE such as VS2005 that can do it
    // that when you type ->, you will see a list of tall the methods the object supports.
    //
    psr->program(psr);
