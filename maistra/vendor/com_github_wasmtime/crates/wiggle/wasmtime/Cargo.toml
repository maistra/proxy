# The wiggle proc-macro emits some code (inside `pub mod metadata`) guarded
# by the `wiggle_metadata` feature flag. We use this feature flag so that
# users of wiggle are not forced to take a direct dependency on the `witx`
# crate unless they want it.
wiggle_metadata = ['witx', "wiggle/wiggle_metadata"]

# The `tracing` crate can use the `log` ecosystem of backends with this
# non-default feature. We don't need to provide this by default, but its
# useful for users that don't want to use `tracing-subscriber` to get
# the logs out of wiggle-generated libraries.
